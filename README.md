This app allows users to securely authenticate themselves and chat with a simple and clean UI. While it is not a fully featured chat app, it ensures users can safely log in and out, keeping their data private.

**Disclaimer**: This app was created in conjunction with Angela Yu's AppBrewery iOS Bootcamp Course.

## Technologies and Tools Used:

- UIKit (Storyboard): The user interface of the app was designed using UIKit and storyboards.
- MVC Architecture: The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating its components for better organization.
- CocoaPods: Third-party library integration is supported using CocoaPods, making it easy to add and manage dependencies.
- Firebase: The app uses Firebase's Firestore to allow users to log in securely and store chat data.
